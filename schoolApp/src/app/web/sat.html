        <p class="sub-heading">The SAT is a standardized test used for college admissions at most institutions in the United States, and in many other countries as well. SAT originally stood for "Scholastic Aptitude Test," but it is now generally known only by its acronym. The test is owned and administered by the College Board, which is a "mission-driven not-for-profit organization that connects students to college success and opportunity."</p><br>
