        <h3 class="title-bold">Merit-based :</h3>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            These awards are based on a student's academic scores, artistic, athletic or other extra curricular activities, abilities, and community service record. The most common merit-based scholarships, awarded by either private institutions/organisation or directly by a student's intended college, recognise academic achievement or top scores on standardized tests. Most such merit-based scholarships are paid directly by the institution to the student attends, rather than issued directly to the student.

        <h3 class="title-bold">Need based Scholarship :</h3>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            Mostly federal student aid is need-based i.e citizens. That means it doesn't discriminate by any factor apart from financial need. Eligibility is based solely on the assets and income of the prospective student and his or her family. Factors such as test scores or athletic ability have no bearing on need-based aid.

        <h3 class="title-bold">School-Based Scholarships :</h3>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            School based scholarships are most often related to a specific level of studies such as bachelor or masters scholarships, or to a specific program, such as business scholarship or engineering scholarships. scholarships may be offered directly from the school or sometimes, from a individual private donor who is associated with the university such as an alumni who has set up a scholarship foundation. Sometimes these individual scholarships are offered to individual students with university admission and yet time student do not need to apply also.
