            The number of students opting for higher education abroad has increased exponentially in the past two
            decades. Also, there is a drastic increase in the number of students opting for overseas education loan due
            to increase in the expenses of quality education abroad. Today there are numerous lenders offering loans to
            students.

            </ul>
            </p>
      

        <p class="sub-heading">
            Lenders have their own criteria developed for the upper limit of the loan, the interest rate to be charged
            and the period and mode of repayment.

            Lenders usually have some pre-approved courses and institutions and usually sanction education loans on the
            basis of the quality of the institution, relevance of the course to career options, credit worthiness of the
            guarantor or co-applicant.

            For those applying for education loan for India, lenders will look for AICTE or UGC approval
