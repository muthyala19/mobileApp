        <p class="sub-heading">
            The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) measures the language proficiency of people who
            want to study or work where English is used as a language of communication. It uses a nine-band scale to
            clearly identify levels of proficiency, from non-user (band score 1) through to expert (band score 9). </p>
        <br>
        <p class="sub-heading">IELTS is available in two test versions: Academic - for people applying for higher
            education or professional registration, and General Training for those migrating to Australia, Canada and
            the UK, or applying for secondary education, training programmes and work experience in an English-speaking
            environment. Both versions provide a valid and accurate assessment of the four language skills: listening,
            reading, writing and speaking.</p><br>

        <h3 class="title-bold">IELTS Academic</h3>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            The IELTS Academic test is for people applying for higher education or professional registration in an
            English speaking environment. It reflects some of the features of academic language and assesses whether you
            are ready to begin studying or training.
        </p><br>
        <h3 class="title-bold"> IELTS General Training</h3>
        <p class="sub-heading"> The IELTS General Training test is for those who are going to English speaking countries
            for secondary education, work experience or training programs. It is also a requirement for migration to
            Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. The test focuses on basic survival skills in broad social and
            workplace contexts.
