        <p class="sub-heading">
            While getting into a University at abroad is a matter of cheer, often the exhilaration is dampened by the
            prospect of a Visa Interview. Students from across the country swear by the gruelling sessions with the Visa
            Interviewer and how all their plans might simply go to waste if the person rejects the application.
            Well...all that is true but at the same time, there is nothing to fear. The interviewer is not tasked with a
            target of rejecting applications! His/her only purpose is to validate your reasons for visiting country and
            by no means are they intent on thwarting your abroad dreams – until and unless the dream constitutes of
            staying as illegals. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="sub-heading">It is important to understand that while the Visa Interview is an integral part of your
            Student Visa Application, it is by no means the lengthiest. In fact, on an average, the Visa Interview would
            last about 5 – 10 minutes (sometimes even lesser). As a rule, the Visa Officers do not ask for any
            documents. Though you are always recommended to carry them with you, it is important to note that you must
            not offer your documents until and unless asked.
            <br>
            This guide tries to remove a few misconceptions about the Visa Interview, provide Basic Do's and Don'ts and
            also lists down a few frequently asked questions with pointers to guide you on how to best answer these
            questions. Remember, there are no rules here. Like any interview, every interview is bound to be unique.
            What remains constant, however, is that like any interview the key is confidence and intent.

        <p class="sub-heading">
            Things you should know before you go for your Student Visa Interview <br>

            Like any interview, it is a formal interaction between two or more people – the Interviewer/s and the
            Interviewee. And like any interview, you need to prep for this one as well. So, before you start prepping
            about the questions or worrying about the Interview Officer, here are few things you must do. Remember,
            doing your homework is the key to success...
